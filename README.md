## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Python not found"**
   - Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org)
   - Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. **"Module not found" errors**
   - Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Make sure you're in the correct directory

3. **Executable won't start**
   - Try running from Command Prompt to see error messages
   - Make sure all dependencies were installed correctly

4. **Slow startup**
   - First run may be slower as it loads all dependencies
   - Subsequent runs should be faster

### Getting Help

- Check the `BUILD_INFO.txt` file after building
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection for data fetching
- Make sure Windows Defender or antivirus isn't blocking the executable
